# Login-Generator

# What is this?

This web app randomly generates numbers and letters as a string of 8 or 12 characters. The motivation behind this app is that
I tend to sign up for online accounts (some of these accounts which I only use once and that's all); I don't like having to think about
what the user name and password would be, so creating this app helps to ease the process. I also added a couple features for storing and retrieving this data to/from the database.


# My Thoughts/What I learned:

I remembered going over many tutorials on assembling a full-stack MERN application, and having to learn how to deploy this over to Heroku.
The learning process for this was not easy, and there were not many detailed tutorials on how to do this at the time. Moreover, after going
back and forth in learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/React.js/Node.js, I would say that I now have a decent level of understanding on
building all of this from scratch and following the MVC architecture model.
